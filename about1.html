  <h1><font color="yellow"> <center><i>Hello! </i></center></font></h1><p>I'm a first-year student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (TIET), pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. My journey into the world of technology has been both exciting and challenging, and I'm always eager to learn and explore more.
</p><p>
I have a strong foundation in web development with knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, and PL/SQL, and I'm gradually expanding my skills in JavaScript and Python. I've also built a project in C++, which has helped me sharpen my problem-solving abilities and deepen my understanding of programming concepts.
<font color="green">You can check my projects under the 'Projects' Tab.</font>
</p><p>
Beyond academics, I'm passionate about sports, particularly<u> Karate </u>. I've had the honor of representing my district and state, and I've achieved the title of champion at both levels.
</p><p>
As I continue to grow and learn in this field, I'm excited to take on new challenges, build innovative projects, and contribute to the tech community.
